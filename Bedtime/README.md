While the Bed Settings shortcut works independently as an on/off toggle, you can set an automation to trigger the Bed Settings Automation shortcut (which reverts the effects of Bed Settings).
You can set the trigger of the automation as a certain time of day, sunrise for example, so that if you turned on Bed Settings at night, its settings would revert on sunrise.
